# VGCS Coding Challenge - Tom McElderry

Hi guys. Here is my submission for the VGCS coding 

## Usage

### Import the mock JSON file into Mockoon and start the server.

I have included the [Mockoon JSON](docs/mock-data.json) that I developed against in this repo incase multiple versions exist with subtle differences.

If Mockoon is not running locally, you can change the API url [src/config/config.json](src/config/config.json)

### Install npm modules and start the app

```
npm install
npm start
```

A browser should open and display the app.

If not, you can access the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)
